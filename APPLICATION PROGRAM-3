Social networks consist of individuals connected through various 
relationships. Analyzing the connectivity within a social network can 
provide insights into communities, influence propagation, and 
information flow. One way to analyze the connectivity is to find the 
connected components within the network. Given a social network 
represented as an adjacency matrix, the task is to find the connected 
components using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. The 
program should implement the DFS algorithm to traverse the 
network, identify the connected components, and display them.
